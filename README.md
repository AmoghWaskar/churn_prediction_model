This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on customer churn data and
applies regression-based machine learning models to analyze factors influencing
customer churn. Visualizations support data understanding and model evaluation.

# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis and machine learning to understand
and predict customer churn. The objective is to analyze customer behavior and identify
key factors that influence churn using regression models.

## Dataset
- Customer churn structured dataset
- Includes demographic and behavioral features
- Cleaned and prepared for analysis and modeling

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA is performed to:
- Understand customer data distribution
- Identify important churn-related features
- Analyze correlations and trends
- Detect missing values and outliers

## Data Visualization
Visualizations used in this project:
- Histograms for feature distribution
- Bar plots for categorical analysis
- Scatter plots for relationship analysis
- Correlation heatmaps

## Machine Learning Models
- Multiple regression-based models
- Train-test split
- Feature scaling
- Model training and prediction

## Model Evaluation
- R² Score
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Model comparison

## Outcome
- Identification of key churn-driving factors
- Performance comparison of regression models
- Data-driven insights to support retention strategies
